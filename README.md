## Core Info
### What "E4U" is
In short, "E4U" is a platform for managing energy usage, a major contributor to global warming.

## Story
> The following story aligns with the four steps in composition.

### Step 1.  The beginning of environmental change
The transformation of the planet as we know it is closely linked to the onset of industrialization. 
With the onset of industrialization, people began to utilize machines and technology to live more efficiently, but there was a hidden problem behind this progress. 
The mass production of goods in large numbers in factories resulted in the release of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases. 
As these gases were released into the Earth's atmosphere, they caused the greenhouse effect, which led to the depletion of the ozone layer and a variety of extreme weather events. 
As a result, the Earth's temperatures were gradually rising.

### Step 2. Changes in energy consumption
As temperatures rose, people began to feel increasingly uncomfortable in their living environments, especially during the summer months, when heat waves greatly affected people's lives. 
This led to a sharp increase in the use of cooling devices such as air conditioners. 
This led to a sharp increase in electricity consumption, and a significant increase in per capita electricity consumption. 
To meet this demand for electricity, the construction and operation of thermal power plants expanded.

### Step 3. Letting technology help
To find a solution to this problem, researchers began to delve deeper into the relationship between temperature and power consumption. 
This led to the idea of creating a service that would predict power consumption as a function of temperature. 
The service would utilize a variety of data and technologies to train a model that could predict power consumption as a function of future temperature changes.

### Step 4. Looking to the future
We are now able to utilize technology to predict future power consumption, which is expected to help us manage power consumption more efficiently and protect the environment. 
This technology can also be utilized in other industries, paving the way for a sustainable future.
